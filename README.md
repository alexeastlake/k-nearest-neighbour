# k-nearest-neighbour
An implementation of the k-nearest neighbour machine learning algorithm.

The program takes a data file name as an argument:

"python3 knearestneighbour.py iris.data"

It randomly splits the dataset into training and test subsets, and prints the classification accuracy of the algorithm on the test subset. It has been tested on the Iris dataset.
